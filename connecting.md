# Connecting to a meeting

For the best experience, ensure you are connected through both audio and chat

## Audio
We recommend you connect to our meetings with an SIP client. To do this, you need:
- a SIP client installed on your device
- a SIP account

If you need help selecting a SIP client, [Linphone](http://www.linphone.org/) is an example SIP client that is free and available on many platforms. Here is [Linphone's account setup form](https://www.linphone.org/free-sip-service.html).

Once your SIP client is set up, connect to the CCG call at [sip:ccg@96.89.14.196](sip:ccg@96.89.14.196).

If for some reason you're not able to connect via a SIP client, you can dial in by phone [+1.540.961.4469 x6306](tel:+15409614469;postd=p6306).

## Chat
During the meeting, we use IRC to share links, keep meeting minutes, ask questions, etc.

If you're unfamiliar with IRC, note that you can easily connect through a browser with this link: [http://irc.w3.org/?channels=ccg](http://irc.w3.org/?channels=ccg).

Otherwise, the general IRC link is: [irc://irc.w3.org:6665/#ccg](irc://irc.w3.org:6665/#ccg)
